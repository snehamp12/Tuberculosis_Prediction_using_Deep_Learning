# TB Prediction Using Deep Learning

This project uses deep learning models to predict Tuberculosis (TB) based on medical data/images.

## Project Files

- `app.py` – Main application script (likely Flask-based)
- `index.html` – Frontend UI for the web app
- `hero.jpg` – Image used in the web interface
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies
- `graph.py`, `graph_resnet.py`, `graphs_vgg16.py` – Scripts for plotting model graphs
- `resnet16.ipynb`, `vgg16.ipynb` – Jupyter notebooks for training/testing deep learning models

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/snehamp12/Tuberculosis_Prediction_using_Deep_Learning.git
   ```
